# Unit 19 React Homework: Employee Viewer app

## Description

This assignment demonstrates creating an employee directory with React. To achieve this, the application's UI has been broken down into components, manage component state, and respond to user events. When the user loads the page, a table of employees should render. The user should be able to:

  * Sort the table by at least one category

  * Filter the users by at least one property.


## User Story

* As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.
